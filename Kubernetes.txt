 Kubernetes or simple K8's which means 8 letters between K and S is an open-source tool that is more than just container orchestration, 
which means managing several containers for an application that is deployed across several servers.
Besides that, Kubernetes is also used for deploying, rolling out changes, scaling, and monitoring, making it easy to manage applications.
